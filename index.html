              The dashboard empowers Spotify to make data-driven decisions. It uses a sample dataset self collected by user. But,this doesn't have to be most accurate numbers as music varies widely across regions. These numbers can be from one region where the user has collected. 
              But this dashboard can help in identifying target demographics(subscriptions), refining content offerings, optimizing the app for various devices, and ultimately improving user satisfaction and engagement. By understanding user preferences and observing the playlist patterns, Spotify can continuously enhance its app and curate personalized recommendations.
              The visualizations and analysis will help stakeholders gain a deeper understanding of Spotify's evolving userbase from various regions and make decisions to drive further growth and enhance user experience to stay ahead in the highly competitive music streaming and podcasting industry.</p>
