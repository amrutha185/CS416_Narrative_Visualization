# Spotify Users Insights Hub
This narrative visualization is divided into three scenes to analyze User Behavior in using the Spotify app.

## Overview

## Scene 1: 
As a user, when considering any app, one common aspect that immediately comes to mind is the Subscription. This scene provides insights into the Spotify app's subscription, analyzing the number of people interested in getting a Premium subscription over a Free subscription. The pie chart presents these statistics, and by clicking on each pie, you can understand that the app is popular for more than 2 years. Looking at the number of users by subscription type more people are using free subscriptions over Premium subscriptions.

## Scene 2: 
The next consideration revolves around app usage on different electronic devices. This scene Device Usage offers valuable insights into Spotify's device usage patterns, with smartphones emerging as the most popular choice. Clicking on each device's corresponding bar updates the adjacent chart to display the age group distribution. Notably, the 20-35 age group dominates across all devices, but interestingly, the 6-12 age group also utilizes the Spotify app, providing a surprising observation.

## Scene 3: 
As the app itself is for music and podcasts, the next scene is to determine User Interests that how many users have been using Spotify for different types of music or different formats of podcasts. The outcome shows that podcasts are not as popular as music. So, that explains why Spotify can focus on improving user preferences in the podcasts area.
