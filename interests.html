          <p>From comparing the user numbers between the two charts suggests that Spotify's  has a strong user base in  music as a  primary choice of content. 
            Although, this is a small dataset self collected by a user, the music preferences may vary by region. So, Melody may not be the most popular music across all regions.
             However, the comparison shows that  there are more opportunities for improvement and growth in the podcasting area. Spotify could enhance search functionality within podcasts and provide more curated podcast playlists and personalized podcast recommendations based on the user's preferences for overall podcast listening experience within the app.
             Spotify can expand its reach and establish itself as a go-to platform for both music and podcasts by making more improvements to the app itself.</p>
